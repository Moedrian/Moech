## Today I Learned

* When you need to require a file in a class file using relative path, better write it like ```require __dir__ . '/../path/to/file'```

* Before ```git commit```, make sure there's no ```echo``` statement

* if there is files appeared in current directory whose affix like ```un``` after quitting vim, open vim and input ```:e $MYVIMRC``` then append these lines:
  * ```set nobackup```
  * ```set noswapfile```
  * ```set noundofile```

## Warning

* BAD GRAMMAR! and SPELLS!
