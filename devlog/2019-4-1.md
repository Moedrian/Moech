# So Far Away

## Learned

* Redis lists
* Redis sets
* Redis sorted sets
* Redis primary management
* A glimpse of Lua, Bitmaps, HyperLogLog, Channel and GEO

## Started

* class actually nothing

## Planned

* Code after getting used to Redis
* So after reading some examples about php-redis I can start coding?
* DevOps is fricking hard to do 

## Mindblown

* Suggested not using multi-database in Redis' production env but multi-instance seems legit
* And now you should learn some Lua?
